# Style
Some ancient arena with a lot of traps and obstacles. Two team of the players are fighting each other.

The arena features a mirrored structure on the ceiling, but the layout above doesn't necessarily have to be an exact replica of the ground below. While it maintains overall symmetry, there can be unique elements or variations in the placement of obstacles and shelters, providing diversity and tactical depth to the gameplay. The ceiling structure can be used players with `special` ability to invert gravity and walk on the ceiling.
